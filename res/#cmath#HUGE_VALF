<div id="I_description">Huge float value</div>
<section id="description">
Macro constant that expands to a positive expression of type <code>float</code>.<br>
<br>
A function returns this value when the result of a mathematical operation yields a value that is too large in magnitude to be representable with its return type. This is one of the possible <i>range errors</i>, and is signaled by setting <samp><a href="/errno">errno</a></samp> to <samp><a href="/ERANGE">ERANGE</a></samp>.<br>
<br>
Actually, functions may either return a positive or a negative <samp>HUGE_VALF</samp> (<samp>HUGE_VALF</samp> or <samp>-HUGE_VALF</samp>) to indicate the sign of the result.<br>
