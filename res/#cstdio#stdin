<section id="description">
The standard input stream is the default source of data for applications. In most systems, it is usually directed by default to the keyboard.<br>
<br>
<tt>stdin</tt> can be used as an argument for any function that expects an input stream (<tt>FILE*</tt>) as one of its parameters, like <a href="/fgets">fgets</a> or <a href="/fscanf">fscanf</a>.<br>
<br>
Although it is commonly assumed that the source of data for <tt>stdin</tt> is going to be a keyboard, this may not be the case even in regular console systems, since <tt>stdin</tt> can generally be redirected on most operating systems at the time of invoking the application. For example, many systems, among them DOS/Windows and most UNIX shells, support the following command syntax:<br>
<br>
<tt>myapplication &lt; example.txt</tt> <br>
<br>
to use the content of the file <tt>example.txt</tt> as the primary source of data for <tt>myapplication</tt> instead of the console keyboard.<br>
<br>
It is also possible to redirect <tt>stdin</tt> to some other source of data from within a program by using the <a href="/freopen">freopen</a> function.<br>
<br>
If <tt>stdin</tt> is known to not refer to an interactive device, the stream is <i>fully buffered</i>. Otherwise, it is library-dependent whether the stream is <i>line buffered</i> or <i>not buffered</i> by default (see <a href="/setvbuf">setvbuf</a>).<br>
